### hi there :scream:

i'm Romain l'Ourson, :fr: web developper, focused on JS, [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) technologies. I have a growing ðŸŒ± interest in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org/).

:construction: iâ€™m currently working on [livres-ouverts](livres-ouverts.fr), an open-source project that aims at making french cities budgets more accessible to the public. Because open-data is not accessible-data. And it should be.

:thought_balloon: iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any public interest project that involves Javascript or cheesecakes.

:notes: ask me about which Beatles album is the best. Rubber Soul, obviously.

:bird: you can find me on Twitter [@r_ourson](https://twitter.com/r_ourson), but i'm not a tweet machine (yet).

:cake: i do have a thing for cheesecakes.
