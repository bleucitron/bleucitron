# hi there :scream:

### i'm Romain l'Ourson, :fr: web developper, focused on JS, [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) technologies, with a growing ðŸŒ± interest in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org/).

:construction: iâ€™m currently working on [livres-ouverts](livres-ouverts.fr), an open-source project that aims at making french cities budgets more accessible to the public, because open-data is not accessible-data.

:book: i'm a JS instructor.

:thought_balloon: iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any public interest project that involves Javascript or cheesecakes.

:bird: you can find me on Twitter [@r_ourson](https://twitter.com/r_ourson), but i'm not a tweet machine (yet).

:notes: ask me about which Beatles album is the best (Rubber Soul, obviously).

:dancers: i dance Lindy Hop.

:video_game: i play on Switch. 900 koroks. Only 17 with help.

:pencil2: i need to draw more often.

:cake: i do have a thing for cheesecakes.
